This is the default location for schedules that tell LectureSight when
to start and stop it's camera tracking activity.

The service uses iCal as the calendar format. By default the system looks for
a file named 'schedule.ics'. 

configuration property: cv.lecturesight.scheduler.schedule.file

Any change to the file will automatically trigger
a reaload of the schedule. The internal schedule is emptied when the configured
iCal file is deleted. 

The scheduler is compatible with the iCal schedules generated by Opencast. Per
default all events in a schedule file are taken into account. It is however
possible to configure the name of the Opencast Capture Agent that the system
should act along with.

configuration property: cv.lecturesight.scheduler.agent.name
