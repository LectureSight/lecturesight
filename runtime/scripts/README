This is the location where the camera operator script files live.

This directory is watched by the scripting service. The scripting service
will notice when the configured camera operator script changes and re-load
and re-start it automatically. 

configuration property: cv.lecturesight.cameraoperator.scripted.script

Every camera operator script can bring its own configuration file. The 
scripting service will detect files with the same name as the script
file but with the suffix .cfg and load them as the scripts configuration.
So the script 'default.js' can have a configuration file 'default.cfg'.

Script configuration files are standard Java property files. All properties
defined in the script file will be accessible in script scope as properties
of the 'Config' object.
