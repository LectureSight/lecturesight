# LectureSight Style Guide

## Code

* LectureSight uses checkstyle rules to enforce code style, defined in `src/docs/checkstyle/lecturesight-checkstyle.xml`
* Indents are two spaces.

## Documentation

The following conventions are used in documentation:

* LectureSight has L and S capitalized.
* GStreamer has G and S capitalized.
* Names that refer to classes or interfaces are italicized and follow the case rules used in the source, for example _HeartBeat_ service.
* Module names (src/modules/) are quoted with backticks, for example `lecturesight-heartbeat` module.
