# Scene Profile Editor

The **Scene Profile Editor** allows zones to be defined which affect the video analysis:

* **Ignore Zones** are masked out from the input frame before video analysis. Add ignore regions to mask areas of the overview input that are not of interest for tracking, for example audience seating, doorways, or projector screens.
* **Tracking Zones**, **Trigger Zones** and **Measure Zones** are not presently used by LectureSight.
* **Calibration Markers** are not used by LectureSight, but may be used to note specific points on the overview image for later reference (for example to verify that the overview camera has not moved since installation).
